## Project Summary
This project is an interactive data analysis of over 800 Pokémon characters using Microsoft Power BI. The goal was to uncover patterns, trends, and insights within the Pokémon universe through advanced visualizations and data storytelling.

## Objectives
1)Analyze the distribution of Pokémon by type, generation, and legendary status.

2)Compare Pokémon stats such as Attack, Defense, Speed, and Total.

3)Identify the strongest Pokémon overall and by type.

4)Visualize trends across different generations of Pokémon games.

## Tools & Technologies
Power BI: Data modeling, DAX, dashboard creation.

Excel / CSV Dataset: Cleaned and prepared Pokémon data.

DAX: For calculated columns and measures

## Key Insights
Water, Normal, and Grass are the most common Pokémon types.

Legendary Pokémon (like Mewtwo and Rayquaza) have significantly higher overall stats than regular Pokémon.

Generation 1 introduced the largest number of Pokémon.

There is a moderate correlation between Attack and Defense, and speed varies widely among top Pokémon.

Pokémon of rare types (Dragon, Ice, Ghost) are fewer in number but often have higher base stats.
